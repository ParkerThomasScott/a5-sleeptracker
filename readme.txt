W3Schools
Github
Angular.io
Stackoverflow


3. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
None.



4. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
The code is incomplete. Some of the interface works, but fundamental features may not run. 



--Aim for no more than a few sentences for each of the following questions.--


5. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom? Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
The design of the app tried to encompass both platforms. Its intended end-product was an app that displayed the logs by default, switching between them with two tabs at the bottom, and a floating FAB button to add a log of either type. 



6. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
A FAB button was used in order to add overnight sleep logs to the existing logs by pressing the Moon icon that came up. The intention was for this to bring up a modal page that would allow you to enter an overnight sleep log. 


7. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
A FAB button was used in order to add overnight sleep logs to the existing logs by pressing the Sun icon that came up. The intention was for this to bring up a modal page that would allow you to enter an sleepiness log. 



8. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
The intention was to display the data in two tabs, as described above. We did not want to display all the logs at once, but wanted to make it easy and obvious to the user how they can view their logs. Additionally, seeing them by default grants quick access if the user wants to check the logs. 


9. Which feature did you add for A5--using a native device resource, backing up logged data to Firebase, or both? If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?
We were unable to get the Ionic DevApp working on our networks, so we could not use the native device resource (no method to test with). We attempted Firebase. We were able to insert a stringified JSON into Firebase, but did not have time to figure out how to parse the actual live data structures. We did not successfully pull data from the database to display. 

10. Did you add any "extra" features, such as other data to log, changes to the styling of the app? If so, what did you add? How do these add to the experience of the app?
The main styling change was to separate out the log views into the two tabs and to put the add log features behind the FAB button. This was intended to make the interface more clean and intuitive. 

As a note, we struggled with the assignment, and we also had to prioritize a different group project in crisis for another class over this one. By the time we were able to work on this for a few days, there was no longer enough time to deal with the number of errors, confusion, and frustration inherent to get it working before the deadline. Some design work was done successfully, so we figured we should turn it in at the very least.
